   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npx prisma db seed
   ```
4. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend

   cd vending-machine/vending-machine-frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## API Documentation

- The backend API is documented with Swagger.
- Access docs at: `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`
- OpenAPI spec: `vending-machine-backend/swagger/swagger.json`

---

## Assumptions

- The vending machine accepts only specific denominations as defined in the backend logic.
- Product inventory and coin stock are managed in the database and must be sufficient for a transaction to succeed.
- All API requests are validated using Zod schemas for type and structure.
- The database is seeded with initial data for development and testing; production deployments should use persistent storage.
- Change is dispensed only if the machine has enough coins; otherwise, the purchase is rejected.
- Error responses are always in JSON format with appropriate HTTP status codes.
